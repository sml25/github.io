# Interest in IT

**What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).** 

I have no experience in IT but over the last 13 years of my work life I have worked very close with IT, product and development teams with onboarding, migration, upgrades and deployments. Currently, I am account manager that deals with the client facing aspect of various IT financing solutions, and the trigger that sparked my interest in IT was that I want to also be able to do the technical side myself and not want to ask or have IT explain or action on the situation or provide the resolution. 

The technical IT side of the business interests me and I would like to one day work in IT technical related positions. 

Using end user feedback to deliver value added customized analysis through improved UI experience. Also by understanding current work flow processes and the pain points to resolve issues, develop and to grow a product.

I would like to learn IT environments, the actions and processes required to construct IT systems and how to maintain, improve and fix issues. 

I believe this course will provide me with the knowledge across the broad spectrum of the IT industry and to expand my career choices in the future.

**Why did you choose to come to RMIT?** 

I am Australian and work full time in HK. I decided to take on a course this year that is credited for an undergraduate degree and researched various sites locally and internationally. 

I found the Online University Australia (OUA) site and it was very easy to use and the universities are very familiar to me as I grew up in Australia. The Undergraduate Information Technology course at RMIT suited my situation as I need a flexible 100 percent online course, especially there is a few hours' time difference with HK and I work fulltime. I am also able to sit my sit the exams in HK as an option, which is great. The application and payment was seamless as I went through OUA online and the entire process was easy and quick. 

**What do you expect to learn during your studies?** 

After graduating from the undergraduate Bachelor of Information Technology course I expect to have learnt the skills and knowledge on IT infrastructure, environments, process and delivery of developing, maintaining and growing a solution. I would also like to know more about the specialized diverse fields of IT on big data, AI, automation, corporate, banking finance solutions through to corporate and personal use e.g. apps and gaming etc. Ultimately, I would like to be specialized in an area of IT and be able to work in IT related role in the future. 


# Ideal Job


![GetImage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62459754/77226942-0a0c8000-6bb7-11ea-9430-c0347a74cb80.png)

Site: [Cloud Engineer](https://www.seek.com.au/job/41136695?type=standout#searchRequestToken=6e7948a7-0c3c-4666-b89f-821e759a866f)



**• A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.** 

This job<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> is appealing and of interest to me because the employer is a leading financial services organization. My current job is with a financial services provider so I have background and knowledge in the industry.

Organizations are moving to cloud based servers vs their own private company servers due to general maintenance and hosting security. The job sounds challenging and interesting as you are part of the team that designs, deploys and migrate applications onto the cloud.  

**• A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.**

The role involves having experience in specialized skills using Jenkins, Puppet, Ansible and Cloud formation combined with scripting experience (Python, Bash, Shell, Perl etc.)   

Knowledge of the SDLC and continuous integration and need to be tertiary qualified with relevant industry certifications.  

As the company is a leading financial services organization the platforms they offer would be related systems, so as part of the responsibilities is to maintain the platforms within the cloud base environment, deploy fixes, perform migrations and upgrades. 

This would involve a certain extend of trouble shooting and problem solving skills as clients need to connect to our systems within the cloud environment. Clients will need to whitelist the companies domains and be compatible with the systems versions, so set up  and connection is important to understand. 

**• A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.**

I currently don't have any IT skills or experience or foundation knowledge on cloud management.<br/>
My current experiences are client facing account management working with financial services solutions. I have the ability to guide and manage all support and account management related communication working as a partner to our clients in offering a value added service through increasing revenue through their existing coverage and untapped market share.<br/>
I have also managed client systems on live solution platforms that required time sensitive solutions to queries, fixes and improvements through upgrades and employment deployed or managed environments. Posses excellent team skills working across development, IT and relevant stake holders to plan, test and deliver results as expected.

**•A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway), but try to be as specific as you can.**

Firstly, I will need to obtain an undergraduate degree in Information Technology as a tertiary education attainment. This will give me the fundamental basis of the academic credentials needed in the industry. 

Trouble shooting and problem solving skills I believe will come with experience, as you need to be able to understand the products suite, environment and client environment for any issues or queries that may arise. Also, to think outside the box and provide work arounds. 

**Acquiring technical skills in -**
* Knowledge of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and continuous integration 
* Infrastructure code such as Jenkins, Puppet, Ansible and Cloud formation. Scripting experience (Python, Bash, Shell, Perl etc.) 
* Open Source Code
* These expertise skills I hope can be learned within the course or enroll in courses specific to the skill like the below: 
1. RMIT<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup>,<sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup> - [AI Programming with Python](https://online.rmit.edu.au/course/sc-programming-data-science-python-dat104) or [Scripting language](https://www.open.edu.au/subjects/rmit-university-scripting-language-programming-rmi-cpt223)

# Personal Profile

## Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)

![ISFJ-A](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62459754/77227870-31b31680-6bbe-11ea-953b-3f5775e1b8c1.png)

**•What do the results of these tests mean for you?**

The test results allowed me to understand myself more and made me realize there are likewise people in this world and what percentage bracket I represented. I was thus interested to know what my family and friends MBTI was. 

I came to a realization that knowing your personality and knowing others helps with the relationship and communication method. 

It really made me think that about how I could improve, grow and accept my flaws. I actually took the test a few times, to see if I would get the same results and I did. I found especially the Myers-Brigg test<sup>[7](#myfootnote7)</sup> [My MBTI](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/5a09688ae1be3) interesting, and I was able to explore my character within my strengths and weaknesses, Romantic Relationships, Friendships, Parenthood, Career Paths and Work place habits, which are all areas of interest. The sections were not too long to read and concise. 

I believe the most important take away from these results is that based on our likes, morals, preferences it grounds us and allows us to grow, work on the best method of communication and also awakens us to change. 

## TestColor

![TestColor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62459754/77228323-70969b80-6bc1-11ea-9398-b5e5c20c268f.png)


**• How do you think these results may influence your behavior in a team?**

My personality trait which resonates across the 3 test are: 

* Introverted yet can be social 
* Observant and listen well to all points of view, therefore a good collaborator and am empathetic 
* Accommodating, easygoing and carefree attitude 
* Don't like conflict, unfairness, but will definitely speak up when needed 
* Stability and being comfortable and having positive energy is important 
* Don't like negativity, overcoming problems and finding solutions and working with likewise ppl connects me. Although, even if not, can get along with people along as there is open communication

As seen in [TestColor](https://www.testcolor.com/)<sup>[8](#myfootnote8)</sup> and my results as below, I get things done and find whatever means to achieve goals.

Testcolor results had me sway more to being extrovert and I believe that is because I can somewhat be extrovert if need be.

Because I observe, listen, am a team player and like to create a positive friendly environment and I identify with the above listed. I believe these traits will influence the team with good energy, contribute to a friendly open environment. As I may not have the necessary skills but I will complete and deliver the required work taking in and giving feedback along the way. 

Therefore, in groups I am a team player that will contribute and participate as expected through me listening to others, taking on the work load giving my feedback and bring positive energy, in any situation.


## Skills Self Assessment

![Skills](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62459754/77230882-7fd21500-6bd2-11ea-83cf-ae653a4592c8.png)

[SkillsAssessment.pdf](https://github.com/sml25/My-Profile/files/4363112/SkillsAssessment.pdf)

**• How should you take this into account when forming a team?**

Forming a team requires different roles to work cohesively and cooperatively to achieve the same goal through excellent team work. It is good from the get go, that all members of the team identify and express their expectations openly and everyone in the team is allocated clear concise responsibilities with deadlines.  

Therefore, what this test meant to me when form a team, I would take into account the below factors about the team and myself:

* Teams needs a leader, a trusted leader that can achieve goals. From the tests, as I am Altruist, I work thrive under a great, intelligent, persuasive and and inspiring leader
* Structure and organization is important and through team work, I will be a good influence to other team members by encouraging regular calls and updates, as I am a people person and need open communication
* Team dynamics - It would be good to get a mix of characters, therefore we can leverage the different skills and experience in order to utilize our advantages. 
* I am empathetic, poses higher emotional intelligence, therefore am flexible and understanding 

From the [Skills Assessment test](https://www.skillsyouneed.com/quiz/343479?newtest=Y )<sup>[9](#myfootnote9)</sup>my listening skills were just average, I believe I can improve my listening skills since I get along well with teams

I believe the above factors will contribute to good dynamics in a team with my dedication and positive, energetic personality.

</p>                                     

### Overview:

I am passionate about travel and food. Travelling and eating out has become an increasingly normal part of our lives. As I take on new experiences I have learnt to admire different cultures, customs and developed diverse palettes. Like most people, I want to be able to travel and eat more delicious food. 

In the past generations, travel wasn’t as common as it is now, all family members young and old go on worldwide travel. It's no longer rare or special to go abroad. 

Especially living and working in HK, it has exposed me to diversity in an Asian community, that has a completely different life style to what I am use to back home in Sydney. 

### Motivation: 

One consistent topic we all talk about is travel and food recommendations. In our ever so busy lives, coping with stress of working to pay the bills or studying to use our brains, and to be a dutiful mother, father, daughter or son in family obligations, travelling and eating good food is not a luxury as it used to be before, it's become quite normal part of our lives. It has also created higher level of standards in food, service and experience. 

Another important thing to flag is that travelling to other countries like Taipei, Singapore, Japan, Korea and Greater China is so easy, can be cheap, and close by distance. Although, this may be my opinion because I live in HK which is quite central in Asia, distance now is not a big factor as long haul to Europe and US for example is quite affordable and feasible. 

Thus over the years – Instagram, Blogging, YouTube, Mukbangs, for example gives us these experiences which can be shared around the world. The abundance of social media introduces new fads and popular must see and eats. I would hate to have missed a must eat or sight that is popular and a gem within the locals. 

I not only want to know what's near me or in this area, I want to see whether there was blogs, Instagram posts, ppl who have bothered to write about these places or eats not through google only but  through the various social media trends. 

Key point is Especially if people I follow have checked in or blogged, then I would want to know and experience it for myself. 

I believe my idea of an app that brings to you the ease of searching for a city, lists all nearby restaurants and sites but also highlights recommendations or experiences by bloggers, youtubers, mukbangers, and instagrammers. I feel this would be an added bonus and feature that will lure people to use my app over others in the market.  

I also like to be organized when I travel and having my own itinerary builder within the app would make it so much more easier and convenient to store and access the information.

### Description: 

For this assignment I will create a niche app on a specific country only as first steps. 

Please see below my project plan: 

**Name of app**: KoreaSmiling<br/>
**Country of travel**: Korea<br/>
**Why Korea**: The country I have chosen is Korea, as I have extensive knowledge of this country through the culture, KWave (Kpop and Kdrama), also studied the language for 2 years. I travel to Korea annually and try to do it more often if I can<br/>
**What does the app do**:
<br><br>
The app will introduce users to 3 main areas:<br/>
1. Restaurants 
2. Must buys for souvenirs and where to get them 
3. Sights and Must do 

**App Features:** 

* Check in or comment - Users can bookmark their site pages to our app or it can be done from our app to their sites 
* Google maps, weather integration 
* Search by keyword, categories and in app use of hashtags 
* Users can check in where they have bought their must buys and rate it,  
* Link their blogs, Instagram, FB, YouTube, etc. 
* SAVE as a LIST - want to go, or my favorites 
* Alerts from popular social media accounts (set at 1million followers or above), or posts a certain number of videos for example and users you follow 
* Highlights or filtering by user groups - of popular social media accounts (set at 1 million followers or above), or posts a certain number of videos for example and users you follow 
* Voting, have you experienced this and rate?  

Currently google maps does this to a certain extent, but I believe it is much more powerful to bring in reviews, check-ins associated with instagram, youtube videos or blogs on that restaurant as it shows a trend. In google, I still need to click into every review and determine if its good or not, although there is an overall and individual rating does help.  

But, I then do further research on any bloggers, youtubers have made comments and reviews as well, which takes a long time.  You would normally record, bookmark or copy and paste links manually to a word doc or similar for example.  

Some people may not go to the extra mile to research but this app does it easily for you.

</p>                                     

### Tools and Technologies: 

**Software**: Flutter<br/>
**Why**:<br/>
Flutter is a mobile app creator for Androids and iOS applications. It is made by Google and the website itself is very beautiful and fast as the website promotes it. I am not familiar in this area as I am starting new in technology but this website across the others available grabbed my attention. Its attractive, easy to comprehend and with no IT experience I felt like could take on the challenge. Flutter is an open source framework, and any developer may improve its capabilities on GitHub. 

Their clients also are eBay, Sonos, Square, Capital One, Alibaba and Tencent , which are ofcourse are great references. 

**Resources as below**: 
* [Flutter material components gallery](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets/material)<sup>[11](#myfootnote11)</sup>
* [Get started with Flutter](https://flutter.dev)<sup>[12](#myfootnote12)</sup>
* [ Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/?cat=Flutter)<sup>[13](#myfootnote13)</sup>  
* [Discussion Board](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/flutter-dev )<sup>[14](#myfootnote14)</sup>
* [Subscribe to Google Developers channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw?sub_confirmation=1)<sup>[15](#myfootnote1)</sup>

### Skills Required: 

**The below skills are used for Flutter to achieve optimal outcomes**: 

Coding through Dart programming language, [Dart](https://dart.dev/platforms)<sup>[16](#myfootnote16)</sup>
Widgets creation which is intuitive through widget catalogue 
Runs Pythons https server for images  - across any server on the net 
Google Code lab provides quite a lot of guides and tutorials on google map integration, photo sharing etc. which are essential in my travel app [Codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/?cat=Flutter)<sup>[17](#myfootnote17)</sup>
Google assistant for predictive analysis based off searching to load related pages 
Actions using actions.xml in your APK, built in intense search features 

There are a lot of resources available on the website.
Software and hardware are via Flutter using Dart code.

![image](https://www.freewebheaders.com/wp-content/gallery/computer/computer-information-technology-website-header-3014.jpg)

Extra Feature called **"build your itinerary"** which can be a private or public schedule which you can share with other users especially useful for people going on the same trip, or it can just be an itinerary you want to share with friends or acquaintances in general. I am always asked by friends and colleague to send my MUST EAT AND DOS LIST.  

**Having a feature like this:**

* Records my memory of the trip using a template, linking in my social media posts 
* Plans the trip with day 1, day 2 entries with maps and times and the sequence. Tagging feature of date and time. It also gives a visualization if the restaurants and sites are in proximity of each other with smart planning on that day the trip is planned. So, you can easily re-shuffle if need be
* Distance calculation as by Google tool by car, walk so you know you have planned well 
* Easily accessible via the app offline too, so you can display with no internet and can sync back up when there is internet
* Have local language equivalent storage for restaurant/site names and addresses, so you can easily show taxi drivers of where you want to go. No need to search again  but stored off line
* Notes pages – user can record anything else e.g. travel check list to bring, any expenses to record 
* Memories - Links to Instagram, Facebook which gives you history of your experiences of photos, the tagged checked in schedule by simply searching by the travel event in the app
* Calendar view, that displays public holidays, which is useful in planning and logs your trips and sync to outlook feature 

### Draw backs & Obstacles: 

1. Will people really link their blogs, youtubers (mukbangs), Instagram to my APP? What will they get out of it? 
2. Is it too niche? Only people interested or travelling to Korea will use it 
3. Are the restaurants comprehensive. I need to do more research on this 
4. Up to date updates of restaurants closing etc 
5. Have interesting topics of interests for must buys sites 
6. App needs to be fast and stable, users will not got back to Apps if they consistently have loading issues 

### Commercialization: 

**The app can earn money from advertisements from an array of industries**: 

* F&B 
* Hotels 
* Restaurants, airlines, tourism sites 
* Korean language school courses 
* Can cater for local advertisements of Korean foods/restaurants in your country, as long as you turn on Location settings 

### Outcome: 

**The below lists the values of what the app is ultimately wanting to achieve**

* Linking to active Social Media accounts - It's another method for social media users to get more views, they expand their market and make more money. They will become more well known and could even get endorsements to promote from corporations
* Centralized one source to get all your information on the must dos in Korea, save time and efficiency 
* Added bonus to view by trend by active social media profile users feedback 
* Introduce the general public to Korea for those not so well acquainted with this country 
* Key is voting and rating as this provides the feedback from the general public 
* Not only useful for building a personal itinerary but just to keep abreast of the what's popular and new in Korea 

<br/>
I hope that the app will provide users with a joy of exploring up to date and new experiences of Korea and can make their trip a wonderful journey, wanting to come back for more. Incorporating private data and utilizing the power of the web with the latest and most up to date technologies.
